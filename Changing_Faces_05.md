We have a guest! Com here and **lead** this handsome man **inside.**

Where did the new servant **go off to** this time?



He's not bad, eh?

Yeah, but it's a pity that he has no one to **back** him.



**Some Other Day**

He's not **breathing?!**



**Bravo!**

Han,let me introduce Mr.Dong to you. Thanks to him, you're so popular now.

Nice to finally meet you. I've heard a lot about you.

You two **enjoy yourselves.**

Thank you so much, Mister...

It's my **pleasure.**

You're not only a **gifted** performer, but handsome as well.

Mister, you're **flattering** me.

*"There's no Adam's apple..."*

Nice surprise to see you here, Mr.Han. I didn't know you were coming.

It's my hnor that she's also **to your taste.**



Didn't you see? Mr.Han isn't really interested in you. He would never say that if he really **had feelings for** you.

I don't care.



Wait up!

Who are you?!

The Guardian of justice.



**A week later**

This is the last time I perform my **tricks** for you. Take care



Are you feeling better now?

I know I **don't deserve** your **forgiveness** for what I did... I can't perform anymore. When you **recover,** would you be willing to leave here with me? Just give me one more chance, please.

Yes, I'd love to.
