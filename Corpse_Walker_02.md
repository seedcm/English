Corpse Walker 02

###
Commander, it's getting dark. We should **move out.**

You had something to say this morning?

Ummmm... I was hungry. just wanted to see if you had anything to eat.



The more **skilled** a corpse walker is, the more corpses he's able to control. Right?

Actually, the number doesn't **count for much.**

A powerful corpse walker can control the corpses' small **movements,** and even make their eyes **blink.**

That's amazing. So if he can somehow **enable** the dead **to** speak, they'd seem like **the living.**

But still, what's dead is dead.

The building ahead... is that Sector 21?

That should be it.

Here is your second **mission.** Do **not** open it **until** you arrive, and **keep it to yourself.**

*"We're almost there. it's time to open the letter."*

**Upon arriving at Sector 21, kill the corpse walker.**

Is everything OK? We're about to arrive.



Xun, come this way. Let me give you your **payment.**

Do you have a family?

No, I'm alone.

So, this is how you're gonna pay me?

I'm sorry, **Orders are orders.** You have to die.



**How come** there's no **blood...?!**

She's a **corpse?**

*"A powerful corpse walker can control the corpses' small **movements,** and even make their eyes **blink.** "*

*"That's amazing! So if he can somehow **enable** the dead **to** speak, they'd seem like **the living.** "*




I **expected** all of this... Your general **is known for** being ruthless.

How can it be?! YOU are the corpse walker?!

I am alse "Sector 21".

Rise.

**At long last,** six corpses.
