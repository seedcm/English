Wooo, She's really blind. Looks pretty though. Good for us, or we'd **get into trouble.**

Let her go !

Who the hell is this guy?

The Guardian of Justice.

Heh, so you can fight. Better watch out. Next time we meet I'll **kick your ass.**

We're safe now. Are you OK?

Yes. Thanks for saving my life... ...Miss



Last time I came to say goodbye to you. **It was just my luck that** you **happened to** be picked. Fate **brought us together.** Today I'll leave, but I hope we'll meet again in the future.

Is he leaving? Don't look down upon yourself because of your **profession.** if you want to say something from your heart, then just **go for it.**



Han, **we'd better hurry.** Once we arrive in Guangzhou, we need to **catch a plane.** We can't be late.

Mr.Han... ...Can we talk **for a second** before you leave?

It might not **be proper for** a woman to say this...

It doesn't matter. Go ahead.

Does your heart only **belong to** Mr.Dong?

You worry too much. We are just friends. Besides, how could a man **fall in love with** another man...

If you **put it that way,** then can't a woman... ... **fall in love with** another woman?



Changing faces is an honored skill. it can only be passed down within the family; to men, not women. You can't become a master until you've **memorized** the basics.



You're actually a girl? What a liar! I put so much effort into our relationship. If this were to **get out to the public,** what would people think of me?



So **it turns out that** your're... ... I won't say a word to anyone else. Believe me...



Sorry, I can't...
