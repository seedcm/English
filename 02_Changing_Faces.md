Changing Faces 02

Walking alone at night...

If you hear someone behind you calling your name, do not answer.

Why?

Because it's probably a **weasel monster**, and it will **put a spell on** you with its black magic.

Then it will change itself to look just like you and **mess with** your life.

How could that be possible?

Does it look like... ... this?

Ahhh!!!!!!

What a **scaredy-cat**! We just bought this together at the night market!

Wang???



**Get out of** here ! We don't **admit** students.



You're kidding? Mr.Han picked you but all you did was just talk together?

Is there anything wrong with him?

Nah, he's nice.

**All along**, I've had this strange feeling.

I've **handled** all sorts of customers...

But they all seemed to be the same man **in the end**.

**Geeze**, you're **freaking me out** a little!

But, Mr.Han is an exception.



Wang!

What the \*?!

I'm still alive?

You really scared me last night! So you just did that to **get rid of** me and go to the **brothel**?

Oh, my God. You guys don't know what happened last... ... Last night?

People saw you at the **brothel** last night. Don't lie !

I met a monster last night, really! He must have **pertended to be me!**

But you look fine.

Believe it or not!



Isn't that Miss Liu?

Crazy ! Even **the blind** come to watch the opera nowadays.



Sir, leaving so soon?



Please tell your **master** that I'll visit him later today.

I'm very sorry, Mr.Han. My master has another **appointment** today.

Ok, forget it.



Sorry, Mr.Han. Miss Liu has already been picked today.

I know you can't see clearly. Here, let me help you to your seat.

Please, sit here.

I never thought that you would be this **forward**.

Nice surprise to see you here, Mr.Han. I didn't know you were coming.

Sorry to be **rude**.

I heard **you've been attracted to** her recently. So I came here especially to **take a look**. She's really something.

It's my honor that she's also **to your taste**.

Hope you have fun tonight, Bye.

I'll visit you some other day. Have a good night.



Didn't you see? Mr.Han isn't really interested in you.

He would never say that if he really **had feelings for** you.

Why do you have to **be so attached to** him?
