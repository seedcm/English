The Skin Changer 02

***Three months later***

Did you hear the rumors? Someone was killed again.

It's just **as bloody as** last time. Someone tore a hole **in** her **chest** and **ripped** her heart **out.**

Oh, my God. That's **horrible.**

Be quiet! The teacher is coming.

I **guess** everyone has already **heard about** what happened yesterday.

Go straight home after school with the others and don't **hang around.** Got it?

**On another note,** let me introduce our new classmate.

Her name is Lily.

She just had **surgery** performed on her mouth, so she can't speak for a while. Do your best to **make** her **feel welcome.**

Take a seat over there.

Can you use **sign language?** Could you teach me?

Your eyes are so beautiful!

If you need to say anything, just write it down here.



Lily, want to walk out with us?



***Three months ago***

This **medicine** was mixed by my father's mistress. It can stop your skin from changing color for six hours.

When your hair gets more **natural,** you can go to school.

You should try to learn how to control this yourself. We don't want you to get exposed.



We should be getting back. If we're caught alone, I'm afraid the monster will **tear** our hearts **out.**

I'm worried that it was not a monster that did it.

All the people killed had green hair and yellow eyes. Could be that someone is hunting the monster, but they made a mistake.

Hunting?

Rumor has it that if you eat their heart, you can change your skin just like them.

You seem to know a lot about this.

Of course.

**Close call.**

Eh, Lily? It's getting late. Shouldn't you be getting home?

Oh, I got it.

Are you **spacing out?**

You can go back first. Lily is new here. It's too dangerous for her to go back alone. I'll **wait up for** her.

Alright.

Mr.Tong, someone is looking for you.

Mistress?

No need to be so formal.

Why did you come here?

I brought you some dessert. You're **working overtime** tonight, right?

How is her **medicine** working?

These past three months, Lily's hair color has become normal, and her sking has been under control.

If she continues like this, I think we'll be able to let her leave.

Yes. Your father is sure to find her if she stays an longer.

Thanks for your help.

My pleasure, But I'v never seen you to be so kind to a girl befor.

I'm a little bit **jealous.**

Mistress, Please don't say things like that. I'm a different man now.

Yes, you've changed a lot. But there's one thing that has **stayed the same.**

You still like **stealing** things **from** your father.

Mr.Tong! There's been an **accident!**

A **body** has been found in the women's bathroom. It seems like she's from your class. Come and take a look!
