orpse Walker 01

The war in the south is **none of your concern** anymore. Your new **mission** is... ... to take your fellow soldiers to Sector 21 of the Northern Hills.

But sir... that road is **steep** and can't be reached by **vehicle.**

Don't worry. Someone will take them there. All you need to do is to protect them. That's not all. Here is your second **mission.** Do **not** open it **until** you arrive, and **keep it to yourself.**

Yes, sir !

How could it be possible... for one man to transport all those **corpses?**

You'll know soon.



**Commander,** it's an honor to meey you.

*"It **turned out** to be a girl."* Likewise. How may I **address** you?

You can call me Xun.

Ok then. let's **move out.**

Yes, sir.

Rise.

*"This is a little **frightening**; maybe I should say something to **break the silence.** "* Xun, it's good to have you along. **At least** there is someone alive to talk to.

Yes, dead men don't speak.

That's true. so how long have you been a Corpse Walker for?

I'm still only a beginner. These six **corpses** are the most I've handled so far.

One, two, three, four, five... **Hold on,** there're only five **corpses.** Are we **missing** someone?



**My mistake.** There're only five.



Xun, you have an amazing ability to control the dead. Why not **join the army?**

I can control how they move and that's it. In a war, they would just be meat **shields.** 

A part of **victory** still comes from **strengthening troops.** With a secret **weapon** like that, we would never lose a battle.

Secret **weapon?**

Sector 21 is now researching this. We're not sure whether the results would be a success or not.

Commander, **is it appropriate to** tell me this information?

...

We shouldn't **march** anymore during the daytime. Let's take a rest.



*"I heard that all corpse walkers were really ugly... Let me take a look..."*

We **marched** for a whole night. Aren't you tired?

Whatever's **on your mind,** we can talk about it tonight.

Okay.
