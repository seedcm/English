**Seven years ago Lius'family mansion**

Here is another **batch** of wild **game** caught by General Wei.

Not again. i'm getting tired of eating these **day in and day out.**

What should we do with them?

Hmm, their **fur** looks nice. Mywife said that she wanted a **fur coat the other day. Look into** it for me.

As you wish.



What's in the cage, Uncle Li?

This is some wild game caught by General Wei.

Poor little guys ! Can we please just let them go?

But sweetheart... What would I **report to** your father?

OK. Here, I'll let you have the smallest one. But don't tell anyone. It's our little secret.



Okay little guy, **get out of** here.



**One year later**

I heard that the Lius'family **mansion** burned down last night. No one **survived.** What a pity !

What a **coincidence !** General Wei's house burned down as well. Maybe they have the same enemy.

We live in such a dangerous world.



You once saved my life. Now it's time for me to **return the favor.**



Look! Who's that girl? She's pretty, huh.

Looks like her eyes were damaged somehow. Maybe by somoke? Go and find a doctor!



**Five years later**

Who's that guy?

I don't know. I've never seen him here befor.

Excuse me for being **rude,** but would you like to leave here with me?

Thanks for your kindness, Sir... ... But I can't. I've been doing this work for so long. Except for when I'm with a customer... ... I perfer to be with women.

You think I'm too ugly?

You're kidding. Sir. I'm blind and not even able to **see the difference between** my customers.

Blind?! Your eyes...?! It's my **fault.** Alright, if you don't want to come with me, at least let me **stay by your side.**

Do as you wish.



**The day Han was leaving**

Sorry, I can't...

Wait up!

The servant from the **brothel?** Excuse me, I have a ship to catch.

No, you won't. I won't let you go.

Mr. Dong?! This can't be right. Who are you?!

The Guardian of Justice.
