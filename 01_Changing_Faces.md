Bavor!

Amazing!

My God he's handsome!

I didn't expect him to be so **graceful**.

Ummm, handsome **indeed**, but I heard that...

...he is **not into** girls.

No way. But do you think it's possible that... he's gay?



Still not good enough! You're **letting** your ancestors **down**. You should be **ashamed**!

**Kneel**! Don't move !



Sir, Mr.Dong sent these gifts to **express his appreciation** once again.
**Do me a favor.** Tell him not to buy these anymore.



Oh...

Seems like you've learned how to **act spoiled.**

You're the one who spoils me.

Such a **brilliant** performer.

You're a big fish in a small pond, and you **deserver** a bigger stage.

My uncle has contacted some **theaters** in **Venice. They're willing to** send you an invitation.

What do you think? Wanna go?

VENICE?!

I'll wait for two days.

Once you've **thought** it **over**, please tell me **in person.**

Goodbye, Mr.Dong.



Excuse me, Han.

You've met with Mr.Dong a lot **recently**. People are **starting rumors**.

You should try to control yourself **a little bit**.

Rumors? What rumors?

They're saying you're gay.

It's easy to **get rid of rumors**.



Hey handsome, come back soon.



Oh, Mr.Han? What a pleasant surprise! Come in please.

Our girls have been **longing to** see you.

Feel free to pick whoever you like.

Who is the most **on demand?**

You're **straight to the point**. Mr.Han!

Miss Liu has always been the **top choice** here.



This way, please.



Miss Liu has a problem with her **eyesight**. I hope you'll be **generous** enough to excuse her.

Understood. You can go now.

As you wish.



I've heard of your beauty for a long time. Now I know the rumors are true.



**Much appreciated**, Mr.Han, But I'm **wondering...** How did you come to know about me since you never come to such places?

Do you know me?

You're a **well-known** performer. Everyone knows who you are. Even though I can't see, I can still **recognize** your voice.

It's **rough**, yet soft at the same time. how **unique**! ...... I'm **flattered**.

Since you know I don't come around here very often, I would much appreciate your **guidance**.

It turns out that your **hearing** isn't that good either.

You're **prostitute**, a **hooker**. Why try and act so **noble**?

Actually, you're the one who is acting this way. If you're reall such a **noble** person, why come her?



That's strange huh?! I thought Mr.Han was gay.

You don't know? He's been with two girls before.

Strangely, they both died. After that, he was never seen with a girl ever again.

So **he's destined to** bring misfortune to women, huh?

Who knows. Anyway, we can't afford to serve him.
