So this is it?

Are you **kidding** me?

Take it easy, Mr.Tong.

How **rare!** What's this? Can I see it more clearly?

It's a unique **species imported** illegally **from** another country.

Commonly known as a **chameleon.**

Mr.Tong, is this **to** your **taste?**

Just **name** your **price.**



***Tongs' family mansion***

Oh, What's this?

Let me show you.

Master, the lock...

What should we do?

Damn it ! What do you think? Find her, of course!

What happened, father?

Haven't you **resigned from** school yet?

You're no longer a child. You should start considering **taking over** the family business.

Your father is angry at the moment. Just go back to your room.

You can come out now.

Emmm, rare **indeed.**

Don't worry. **I'm different from** my father.

Put on some clothes.

He likes to **collect** rare things. Even his new **mistress** is a powerful **witch.**

What's your name, and where are you from? I'll try to get you back home once it's dark.

Can you speak?

Sorry for being rude.

You have no tongue?

It's too dangerous outside now, and **handing** you **over to** the government is a bad idea.

Wanna stay here?

I happen to have a place for you to hide out. But you must **promise** me one thing. You won't hurt anyone.
