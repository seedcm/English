The Skin Changer 03
---
###
looks like a **suicide.**

The door was locked from the inside. Before it was opened **by force,** she had already been dead for a while.

**Suicide? Is it possible that** somebody locked the door after killing her and then **ran away?**

Doesn't seem likely. It's too **narrow.**

Could it be that the **killer** was a skin changer?

Hiding inside all this time after the girl was killed.

When the cleaner finally opened the door, it might have **taken the opportunity** and tun away.

That's just a rumor. A monster couldn't be that clever.

Besides, would a monster be able to use this?

Was there anyone else here when you found the body?

No.

Mr.Tong.

was she a student from your class?

Yes.

Looks like there's something in the next **stall** over.

It's just a **water bottle.**

Bring it back anyway and **check** it **out.**

Were you her teacher?

Yes.

Can we steal a moment of your time to **help with** the **investigation?**

***Tongs'family mansion***

Interesting. You haven't run away.

Did you kill her?

Didn't we agree that you wouldn't hurt anyone?

Give me your hands.

I was too **naive** to have hoped an animal could act with **humanity.**

You'll stay here until I **turn** you **in** tomorrow.

So, What **ended up** happening this afternoon?

It's still **under investigation.** The police **suspect** it's a suiide.

Is that so...?

The Full Moon Festival is coming up soon. I **plan on** going back to Yunnan tomorrow. **Care to** come with me?

I can't. I've been quite busy **recently.**

Don't worry. Everything will turn out just fine.

Look after your father while I'm gone. You **owe** it **to** him.

Of course I will.



You really didn't kill that girl this afternoon?

Alright. What do you have to **say for yourself?**

Write.

***There's another chameleon.***
